# Advanced GenAI Internship Entrance Test Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for the **Innomatics Research Labs Advanced GenAI Internship Entrance Test**. The test involves:

- Loading datasets from **CSV**, **JSON**, and **SQL** formats
- Merging datasets using **Pandas**
- Data analysis including revenue, membership, city, cuisine, and ratings
- Answering multiple choice, numerical, and fill-in-the-blank questions

## Contents

- `notebooks/Innomatics_GenAI_Entrance.ipynb` — Colab notebook with all solutions, code, and explanations
- `data/` (optional) — original datasets used in the test

## Dataset

The original data files (`orders.csv`, `users.json`, `restaurants.sql`) are **not included** in this repository due to privacy/confidentiality.  
To run the notebook end‑to‑end, upload these files manually in Google Colab under the “Files” section before running cells.

## How to Run

1. Open the notebook in **Google Colab**
2. Run each cell sequentially
3. The final dataset `final_food_delivery_dataset.csv` is generated and used for analysis
4. All numerical and fill-in-the-blank answers are included in the notebook
